		Dina-CMS coding policy and standard


Comments :

	 Please remember to add a easy to understand comment in your code even for each line.
	 there is some comment mark that use by MSPS (My Small Programming Suit) for reporting :
	 	 #+++ : use this when you want remember to do something in code
	 	 #!!! : use this when you want to mark some code for error checking 
	 	 #@@@ : use this to add important note to the Code

Special Strings :
	There is some important Strings that you can use in coding and have special meanning.
	this string remove by some other string in the release time with sps. for example you
	use '@@VERSION@@' string in your code to mark an string for sps , at the release time 
	you run MSPS ( Read MSPS usage please ) for clean up code for release. then MSPS replace
	that string with the version number of Dina-CMS . MSPS look for MSPS.conf file in the 
	current working directory and use that for its action , so remember to add the strings
	in MSPS.conf file
