0. About this document

   This document have a list of branstorms that involved in Dina Project. Due to
current version and future version of Dina this document will contain the list 
of brainstorms.

1. Why does Dina exists ?

   Djnago is one of the greatest web framework in the word. but it does not cover
all the useful features (with respect to Django), that help rapid and easy development.
Django did not provide some functionality that will be handy in web development
because of Django philosophy. some feature like Config framework, Template Manager,
Front-End Manager and etc. Django did not have such features because it choose to be
a complete framework.

2. Goals
   
   The main idea behind the Dina Project is to fill the Django gaps and build as much as
complete web framework/CMS that allow every user to use Dina how his/her want, and with
no pain. Dina must fit with the knowledge level of its user. Each use must access to
specific options that specify with his/her level of knowledge.
