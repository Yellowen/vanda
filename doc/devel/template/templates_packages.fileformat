			Bax-CMS Templates package file format

This documents describe the format and structure of a Bax-CMS template file, this is 
just my idea about this matter and if you have a better idea or want to complete mine
write me in <lxsameer@gmail.com> .

Bax use two kind of templates a distributed form and a centralized form.
    
    Distributed form (DF) : this kind of template packages contains some templates
    		       	    that should install in each app templates directory
		       	    with the goal of making apps more portable
    
    Cetralized form  (CF) : In this form all the templates installed globally . it is
    	       	       	    easier to manage.


Bax-CMS use bzip2 compressed tarball for packing its templates . each template package
file have a directory structure like below:


     Bzip2 Compressed tarball root : /

     	  |
	  |
	  |- package.info	: Contain some information about package and templates like
	     			  Type of template (DF or CF) , author and etc. Refer to 
				  package.info section in this document
          |
	  |
	  |- templates/		: Contain the template files . look at DF and CF section.
	  |
	  |
	  |
	  |- media/		: Contain media files like images , javascript files and etc.
