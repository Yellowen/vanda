In this chapter you will read the most important policies for developing Debbox. If you have any idea please contact me at @email{lxsameer@@gnu.org}.
@section General Policies    
At Debbox Developers Community we warmly welcome those people who wants to join us. so
as a Debbox developer there is some notes that you should bear in mind:

@firstparagraphindent insert
@chapter Requirements
Before jumping in the Debbox development process make sure that you have enough knowledge to use
Python programming language and Django framework. These two are the most important requirements
for Debbox development.

@section Required packages
Debbox will use an isolated environment in the deployed state, to prevent unwanted changes in the
Host OS. Here is a list of required packages with their details for building a Debbox virtual environment:
@sp 1
@itemize
@item
@strong{python-virtualenv}: Debbox use this script to create e virtual environments.
@item
@strong{libev-dev}: This packages is required if you want to use FAPWS3 as the web server backed for Debbox.
@item
@strong{libevent-1.4.2}: This packages is required if you want to use GEvent as the web server backed for Debbox.
@item
@strong{libevent-dev}: This packages is required if you want to use GEvent as the web server backed for Debbox.
@end itemize

@section Building virtual environment
After installing required packages, you can easily build a environment using @file{debbox/bin/envcreator.sh} script. @file{envcreator.sh}
will build a environment in the current working directory with the name of @emph{env}, and install Django, FAPWS3, GEvent and PIL in created
virtualenv directory.

@sp 1
@quotation
@strong{Note}: if you already have a @file{env} directory @file{envcreator.sh} will not clean that environment just installs new packages. But 
if you want to clean the exists environment up, just use @emph{--clean} parameter with @file{envcreator.sh} .
@end quotation
@sp 1
@quotation
@strong{Note}: @file{envcreator.sh} script will install both of FAPWS3 and GEvent in virtual environment. Debbox will use one of them at a time
so if you don't want tu install one of them, just comment the corresponding code in @file{envcreator.sh}  
@end quotation
@sp 1
@quotation
@strong{Warning}: Do not commit you comments (see above note) in @file{envcreator.sh} on the main Repository.
